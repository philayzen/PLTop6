# PLTop6
## Description
PLTop6 started as an app for comparing the traditional top 6 teams with each other. Over time other teams were added due to good performances. The additional teams can be unselected.
## Setup
As of yet, the program only works on Windows.
The application needs an SQL environment. I have set it up using XAMPP & phpmyadmin. 
The correct configurations have to be set up in `%userprofile%/APPDATA/Local/PLTop6/config.properites`.
An example can be found in config.example.properties. 
When running the Jar-file, it creates this configuration file if it doesn't exist.
